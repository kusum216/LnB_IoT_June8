AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING ARDUINO
In this project I have used two software for simulation 1)proteus(7.8)verson,2)Arduino IDE
The Arduino reads the status of the soil using Soil Moisture Sensor. When soil gets the then it Checks for the availability of water using water level sensor, If the water is available, the Pump is turned ON and is automatically turned OFF when sufficient amount of water is supplied.
